# Cyanide

! This is still work in progress !

### Changes

Changes are based on master branch reversion (r164) which was ported by Molexted.

#### r265
* Adjusted geom for new default player scaling (may still need some more work)
* Reworked the main texture theme with metal panels to add more visual detail
* Added decals for some ledges and walls
* Improved use of laser traps (removed those wonky red cubes)
* Lighter ambient colour (mild green tint to vary colour contrast)
* Route entities deleted

### TODO

* Playtest
* Topmost corridor with the ramp/pipe needs to be remixed (obstacle changeS)
* Check lights look consistent and placed well
* Check sound entities for radius placement
* Re-add route entities
* Re-add waypoints
* Probably some other small things

### NOTE

* Map is named cyanide2 for now, to avoid conflict with version that is still in master branch.
* You may be able to walk through some death material, see #922
