#Boni's community data

Here you can find random cubescript snippets, config files and works in progress, which might be useful in some way, but are not suitable for inclusion in the game (yet).

##Race maps

I guess it is a bad idea to clutter the community repo (and its history) with a bunch of low to medium quality maps, so I decided to create a separate repository. This should also make it easier to download a zip ball containing the maps pack only.
