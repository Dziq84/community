This is the "first person player hands" all set up, for those wanting to play around with them, or make their own animations.
As for exporting them, just export using the Blender 2.79 iqm exporter, selecting the rig bone and checking "de-rigify" in the exporter options when you are done, otherwise it won't work.
The "shotgun" and "spell" animations are things made for other things, but i decided to leave them there.
