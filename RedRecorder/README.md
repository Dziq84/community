Brief description:

Bash script was written for Debian. Send the command bash RedRecorder.sh to start the program.

This program is intended as meta-game for Red Eclipse. It provides simple stats as of yet, to record your ratios K/D.

If this interests anyone, I may make this for Windows and other distros on Python.
