Map layouts I've made that have not been finished due to a lack of interest or quality in layout. 

All files licensed under the WTFPL v2.0 unless expicitly mentioned otherwise;
you may redistribute, copy, remake, and modify these works in whatever manner you like.
All files provided "as-is" with no warranty, implied or expicit, to the extent permissible by law.

Maps are generally labeled as either FFA or CTF followed by a number;
survior/duel maps will be noted as FFA and may not be expicitly mentioned.
DTF/BB and Team DM maps all will be labeled with the CTF name and may not be explicitly mentioned.

These layouts are provided in the hopes that someone may take inspiration from them; 
the layouts as-is were deemed unsuitable by me for use in an official map.
