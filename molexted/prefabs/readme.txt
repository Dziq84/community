Some prefabs from the maps I have worked on.
To use them, copy the desired prefab into the prefabs folder inside .redeclipse;
the textures will not match and will have to be fixed manually (as is the case with all prefabs)

Released under the WTFPL v2.0; allows you to use, distribute, remix, and modify the works. They are provided "as-is"
with no warranty or guarentee for suitibility for a particular purpose to the extent of applicable law.

The "voodoo" folder is for manipulations of geometry requiring folding, double texturing, and other geometry tricks to form; these are intended for use in larger creations.

The "structures" folder is for entire, complete pieces of geometry that are generally used relatively unmodified as a significant part of the map.

The "objects" folder is for small, but complete, pieces of geometry that are hard to make or easily usable in a wide variety of situations.

The "maps" folder is for maps which contain notable constructions or uses of geometry.

Many prefabs use "voodoo" in order to function; proper texturing of these may require unintuitive geometry manipulation or texturing in order to modify.
