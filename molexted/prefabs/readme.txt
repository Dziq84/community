Some prefabs from the maps I have worked on.
To use them, copy the desired prefab into the prefabs folder inside .redeclipse;
the textures will not match and will have to be fixed manually.

Released under the WTFPL v2.0; allows you to use, distribute, remix, and modify the works. They are provided "as-is"
with no warranty or guarentee for suitibility for a particular purpose to the extent of applicable law.
