# TheAssassin's Red Eclipse community stuff


## Desktop file

You can use the desktop file to launch Red Eclipse from your desktop
environment's launcher.

Optional: Download the .ico file, put it in your Red Eclipse directory.

Then, download `redeclipse.desktop`, edit the paths inside and put it in
either `~/.local/share/applications/` or, depending on your system, if
the other directory does not work, `/usr/local/share/applications` or
`/usr/share/applications`.

The game should then show up in your launcher.
